# Testing-Practice

This project demonstrates the practice of test-driven development (TDD) using the Jest library in various scenarios, including string manipulation, arithmetic operations, cryptographic algorithms, and array analysis.

## Features

- **capitalize(str):** A function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
- **reverseString(str):** A function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
- **Calculator:** A class that provides basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
- **caesarCipher(str, shift):** A function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character "shifted", with support for case sensitivity, punctuation, and wrapping from 'z' to 'a'.
- **analyzeArray(arr):** A function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with properties: average, min, max, and length.

## How It Works

1. **String Manipulation:** The capitalize and reverseString functions provide basic string operations.
2. **Arithmetic Operations:** The Calculator class offers simple arithmetic calculations.
3. **Caesar Cipher Algorithm:** The caesarCipher function implements the Caesar cipher with specific handling for various edge cases.
4. **Array Analysis:** The analyzeArray function analyzes an array of numbers, providing statistical insights.
